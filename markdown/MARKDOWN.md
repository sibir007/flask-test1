# Code Blocks
Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab. When theyâ€™re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs.

1. Open the file.
2. Find the following code block on line 21:

        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Test</title>
          </head>

3. Update the title to match the name of your website.

# Images

1. Open the file containing the Linux mascot.
2. Marvel at its beauty.

    ![Tux, the Linux mascot](imagformakrdown/image.jpg)

3. Close the file.

# Lists

2. Second item

# Code

# Escaping Backticks

``Use `code` in your Markdown file.``

# Code Blocks
To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>

# Horizontal Rules
To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.

***

        \ 	backslash
        ` 	backtick (see also escaping backticks in code)
        * 	asterisk
        _ 	underscore
        { } 	curly braces
        [ ] 	brackets
        < > 	angle brackets
        ( ) 	parentheses
        # 	pound sign
        + 	plus sign
        - 	minus sign (hyphen)
        . 	dot
        ! 	exclamation mark
        | 	pipe (see also escaping pipe in tables)
